Lexer and Parser Generator

This was initially an assembler, but that got too complicated very quickly so it's now a custom lexer/parser generator

- Uses a recursive descent parser
- Uses a state-of-the-art regular expression for the lexer
- Very simplistic configuration format, easy to use (if you know your syntax at least)
- Optimised*

\*I wrote this months before completion so I don't actually know whether it is optimised or not. I'm going to be hopeful and say that it will be optimised. However I know that it won't be.
